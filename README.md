IMDb Clone Project
This IMDb clone project is a React-based web application that leverages the IMDb API from Rapid API to provide a seamless movie information and browsing experience. It offers a wide array of features, including categorization of movies into three distinct categories: "Popular," "Top Rated," and "Upcoming," each accessible through dedicated pages.

Features
1. IMDb API Integration
The project harnesses the IMDb API, sourced from Rapid API, to obtain up-to-date movie information, ensuring that users have access to the latest data.

2. Custom Card Components
To create an engaging and informative movie listing, custom-made card components are utilized. These cards are designed to provide a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.

3. Carousel for Trending and Latest Movies
The application incorporates a carousel feature within the first section, enabling users to easily view trending and latest movie ratings. This dynamic element enhances the overall user experience.

4. Categorized Movie Listings
The IMDb clone project categorizes movie listings into three different categories: "Popular," "Top Rated," and "Upcoming." Each category has its dedicated page, making it simple for users to explore and discover movies based on their preferences.

5. Popover for Detailed Information
Interactive popovers are implemented within the card components. When users hover over a card, they can access more information about the movie, including a brief summary, release date, and rating.

6. Detailed Movie Information
To provide an in-depth experience, clicking on a movie card opens a detailed page with comprehensive information about the selected movie, including cast, plot, and other pertinent details.
